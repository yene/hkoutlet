# hkoutlet
Turns [pilight](https://www.pilight.org/) outlets into HomeKit accessory using 
[HomeControl](https://github.com/brutella/hc).

I am using Intertechno IT-1500 outlets together with a 433Mhz sender on the Raspberry Pi.

## TODO
* change websocket code to gorilla websocket
* change outlet to switch
* test with siri
* websocket should reconnect, always, test
* pin as flag

----
* pretty pin dialog like homebridge, that works with iOS cam
* use built in JSON methods https://github.com/golang-samples/websocket/blob/master/websocket-chat/src/chat/client.go#L101
* Remove unneeded map
* Integrate the pilight project, the part I need directly here.
* when refused keep retrying to reconnect but inform the user
* when connection refused don't fail, reconnect
* compare project with homebridge pilight
* find a way to silence ipv6 warning

## Bug NewIPTransport name
If the name contains space it does not work. Check in the source if it works without a fake device. Maybe the API is wrong.
